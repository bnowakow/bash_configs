# IndexNow URL submission

`submit-indexnow.py` takes one URL and submits it to all discoverable IndexNow
participants plus the global endpoint. It requires Python 3, with no packages.
Endpoints are discovered from the [official registry](https://www.indexnow.org/searchengines.json)
and each participant's metadata. The [official FAQ](https://www.indexnow.org/faq)
provides fallback endpoints for Amazonbot, Bing, Naver, Seznam.cz, Yandex, and Yep.
The registry also lists the Internet Archive; its endpoint is discovered at runtime.
Discovery uses the registry's engine names and the HTTPS metadata URLs it provides;
differences in metadata `id` values do not reject otherwise valid API endpoints.

## Set up ownership once per website

Run the script with just the URL. If neither `--key` nor `INDEXNOW_KEY` is set,
it asks whether to generate a key. Answer `y` to create `<key>.txt` in the current
directory, containing a cryptographically random key. The script prints the
upload URL and a command to rerun after uploading, then exits without submitting.
If you supply `--key-location`, that is used as the upload destination.

Publish the generated UTF-8 text file at
`https://your-domain.example/<key>.txt` (or your custom key location). The key must
be 8–128 letters, digits, or dashes. You must control the submitted URL's website;
an arbitrary third-party URL cannot be submitted without its ownership key.

## Usage

From the repository root:

```sh
# First run: offer to generate the key and file for upload.
./taerar/submit-indexnow.py 'https://your-domain.example/article'

# After uploading, reuse the key printed by the script.
export INDEXNOW_KEY='your-published-key'
./taerar/submit-indexnow.py 'https://your-domain.example/article?x=1&y=2'

# Discover endpoints and preview without submitting (still needs internet).
./taerar/submit-indexnow.py --dry-run 'https://your-domain.example/article'

# Bypass a slow/unreachable registry and use the known FAQ endpoints.
./taerar/submit-indexnow.py --skip-discovery --timeout 5 \
  'https://your-domain.example/article'

# Alternatively pass the key explicitly and specify a custom key-file location.
./taerar/submit-indexnow.py --key 'your-published-key' \
  --key-location 'https://your-domain.example/catalog/ownership.txt' \
  'https://your-domain.example/catalog/article'
```

Custom key locations can also be set through `INDEXNOW_KEY_LOCATION`. A key file
in a subdirectory only authorizes URLs within that directory. Use the exact host
of the submitted URL (including `www`, if present), and percent-encode non-ASCII
characters in URLs. Quote URLs to preserve shell characters such as `&`.

Each endpoint is attempted once, with a default 15-second timeout per request
(`--timeout` overrides it). Discovery and submissions print progress before each
request. Requests are sequential, so several timeouts can add up. A registry
timeout falls back to known endpoints and does not stop submissions. Use
`--skip-discovery` to bypass registry and metadata requests; this intentionally
limits coverage to the known FAQ endpoints and does not count as a discovery
failure. Failures do not stop the other submissions. Exit code
0 means every attempted endpoint returned HTTP 200 or 202 (or a complete dry
run), or the upload file was generated; 1 means an endpoint failed, discovery was
incomplete, key generation was declined, or the file could not be written;
2 means invalid arguments or a missing key without interactive input.
HTTP 202 means ownership verification is still pending. Fix a 403 by
checking your publicly hosted key file; for 429, wait before submitting again.
DNS failures mean the advertised endpoint could not be resolved. Other engines'
successful submissions remain accepted; rerunning the whole submission is not
necessary just because one endpoint is unavailable.

Terminal output uses blue engine names, yellow successful HTTP codes (200/202)
and warnings, and red failed HTTP codes and network errors. Colors are omitted
when redirecting output or when `NO_COLOR` is set.

As the [protocol documentation](https://www.indexnow.org/documentation) explains,
participating engines share submissions, so one accepted submission already
reaches the network. This script contacts all endpoints to match the requested
behavior. Receipt does not guarantee crawling or indexing; submit URLs when
content is added, updated, or deleted.
