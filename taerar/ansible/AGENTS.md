# Provisioning and temporary rollback

- Show `--unattended` in the bootstrap command at the top of `provision.sh` and
  in both `taerar/README.md` and this directory's README. The switch must select
  the installation-progressing answer for confirmation prompts using each tool's
  supported noninteractive options. Without it, preserve interactive prompts.
  Apply this rule to every future bootstrap command and Ansible playbook task;
  pass the selected mode into playbooks when they are introduced. Do not pipe
  blanket `yes` into commands or attempt to auto-answer passwords or OS dialogs.
- Keep shell provisioning limited to bootstrap: creating the code directory,
  cloning the repository, and installing Homebrew and Ansible. After Ansible is
  installed, implement all subsequent provisioning actions as Ansible playbook
  tasks, invoked by `provision.sh`. This includes the planned dotfile installation
  (`make install-dotfiles`); do not add it as a direct shell provisioning step.
- Whenever `provision.sh` gains or changes a persistent action, update
  `undo-provision.sh` in the same change to reverse it in the opposite order.
- Keep `undo-provision.sh --keep-gh-login` usable for repeated development tests:
  retain GitHub CLI credentials and their rollback snapshot, even when removing
  gh/Homebrew. A later normal provisioning run must reuse the login, and a full
  undo without the switch must remove only the login created by provisioning.
  Never print or copy tokens into logs, playbook output, or the repository.
- Record changes in `~/.homelab-provision-state` outside the checkout. Track only
  resources created or modified by provisioning; preserve pre-existing resources.
  Record intent before operations that can partially fail and keep markers until
  rollback succeeds. Repeated provisioning runs must retain earlier markers.
- Keep rollback usable after a partial provisioning failure and when its own
  checkout is removed. Update the README with behavior and rollback limitations.
- Validate both scripts with `bash -n` and exercise changed branches using mocks
  or an isolated test environment. Do not install/uninstall real software or
  delete the working checkout just to test these scripts.
