# Piwigo (cycuszki)

Private photo gallery for sensitive photos: TrueCharts `piwigo` 22.0.12
(Piwigo 16.4.0, linuxserver.io image) with its MariaDB, in `apps-piwigo`.

## Encryption: where photo data is stored

| Data | Location | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original photos (`upload/`, `galleries/`) | `/gallery` | PVC `piwigo-gallery-longhorn-crypto`, 10Gi, encrypted |
| Thumbnails and resized copies (`www/_data`), config, plugins | `/config` | PVC `piwigo-config-longhorn-crypto`, 5Gi, encrypted |
| Database: titles, tags, EXIF incl. GPS, users | MariaDB | PVC `piwigo-mariadb-data-longhorn-crypto`, 2Gi, encrypted |
| Uploads in transit (PHP upload temp, sessions, nginx body buffers) | `/tmp` | RAM (`emptyDir` medium Memory, 1Gi) |

The PVCs come from `infrastructure/piwigo-storage` and use
`longhorn-crypto-2replicas` (see `infrastructure/longhorn-crypto-storage`).
Their Longhorn NAS backups are encrypted too.

Not covered: CloudCasa. If its backup policy includes `apps-piwigo` and makes
file-level copies, it would upload decrypted photos. Keep `apps-piwigo`
excluded in the CloudCasa portal.

## Login required

`custom-init/90-require-login.sh` (a ConfigMap mounted at
`/custom-cont-init.d`) sets `$conf['guest_access'] = false;` in
`/config/www/local/config/config.inc.php` on every start. Every page then
redirects to the login page, and anonymous visitors see nothing.
Self-registration is switched off in the database (`allow_user_registration`).
Authelia is intentionally not in front.

## Initial admin login (Secret, not in git)

The chart installs Piwigo on first start with the admin account from the
values Secret `apps-piwigo/piwigo-values`. On 2026-11-03 it was created with a
random 24-character password (user `sup`) that was never printed. Read it with:

```sh
kubectl -n apps-piwigo get secret piwigo-values \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.values\.yaml}' | base64 -d
```

The disk-encryption passphrase is read the same way (store it in a password
manager; it is needed to restore the volumes or their NAS backups):

```sh
kubectl -n longhorn-system get secret longhorn-crypto \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.CRYPTO_KEY_VALUE}' | base64 -d; echo
```

To recreate the values Secret by hand, e.g. for a reinstall:

```sh
read -rs 'P?Piwigo admin password: '; echo   # zsh; in bash: read -rsp 'Piwigo admin password: ' P
kubectl -n apps-piwigo create secret generic piwigo-values \
  --from-file=values.yaml=<(printf 'piwigo:\n  admin_user: "sup"\n  admin_pass: "%s"\n  admin_email: "dobrowolski.nowakowski@gmail.com"\n' "$P")
unset P
```

The chart's installer passes this password in the Deployment's `postStart`
command, and Deployments are not encrypted at rest (only Secrets are). So
treat it as a temporary password and change it in Piwigo (Profile) after the
first login. The installer runs only once (`/config/POSTSETUP`); changing the
Secret afterwards does not change the Piwigo password.

## Deployment and validation (2026-11-03)

Applied with `fleet apply` (commands below), not pushed. Validated:

- PVCs Bound, Longhorn volumes `encrypted=true`; in the pods `/gallery`,
  `/config` and the MariaDB data dir are `/dev/mapper/pvc-…` (dm-crypt), `/tmp`
  is tmpfs.
- `[require-login] $conf['guest_access'] = false;` in the pod log; anonymous
  requests to `/`, `/picture.php` and `/register.php` get only the login form,
  `ws.php` API returns 401.
- `allow_user_registration` set to `false` in `piwigo_config` (one-time SQL;
  stored on the encrypted database volume).
- Both certificates Ready.

Gotchas:

- Fleet renders `${...}` in `values.yaml` as its own template syntax, so the
  init script uses `$line`, not `${line}` (the bundle failed with
  `function "line" not defined`).
- Fleet marked `piwigo-storage` not ready while the PVCs were still being
  provisioned and did not re-check, which blocked `piwigo` (`dependent
  bundle(s) are not ready`). Bumping the bundle's `spec.forceSyncGeneration`
  made it re-check.

## Apply

```sh
cd ~/code/bash_configs
fleet apply --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml --namespace fleet-local \
  --label fleet.cattle.io/repo-name=rancher-cluster \
  longhorn-crypto-storage rancher/fleet/infrastructure/longhorn-crypto-storage
fleet apply --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml --namespace fleet-local \
  --label fleet.cattle.io/repo-name=rancher-cluster \
  piwigo-storage rancher/fleet/infrastructure/piwigo-storage
fleet apply --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml --namespace fleet-local \
  --label fleet.cattle.io/repo-name=rancher-cluster \
  piwigo rancher/fleet/apps/piwigo
```
